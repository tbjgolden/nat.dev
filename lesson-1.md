# Lesson 1: How to Terminal

We will learn how to use the terminal in this lesson.

The terminal is known by many names:

- the command line
- a command prompt
- the cli (command line interface)
- the terminal
- the console
- teleprinter or teletypewriter (TTY)

When you open the terminal, it starts a program that you basically have a chat with by typing to it like instant messaging.

On Mac and Linux, it opens either `bash` or `zsh` (pronounced "zeesh" or "z shell" like "sea shell").

Open Terminal: Cmd-Space "Term" Enter

## Why do people use the terminal in 2020?

- Because every terminal behaves more or less the same
- Often it means that you can fix complicated problems with your computer just with a single copy paste
- It is designed to only require the keyboard, meaning you don't need to move your mouse
- It is a universal lightweight interface for working with basically anything on a computer
- For most things, it is faster to type what you want than use a conventional UI
- Things that run inside the terminal use far less of your computers resources
- You can easily chain multiple commands together in a script

The terminal is a power user tool - but anyone who uses a computer for 4+ hours a day already is a power user!

Almost every program you will write needs you to use the terminal to start it. This means that learning how to use the terminal (at least the very basic parts) is a requirement for learning how to write a program.

Perhaps this is the final (and most significant?) reason that developers use the terminal; because they have to.

> There are a few languages that don't actually require the terminal to use, but they all have their own issues that make them inconvenient.

## Commands to learn

Commands can have hard to remember names. Unfortunately, we just have to learn them.

These basics are enough to a surprising amount of things

- `pwd`
- `ls` (`ls -a`) (`ls -l`) (`la -al`)
- `cd ???`

- `man ???`

- `mkdir` (`mkdir -p`)
- `nano`

- `mv`
- `cp`
- `rm` (!)

---

- `echo`
- `vim` (well, how to survive it anyway)

---

- misc concepts
  - Ctrl-C, Cmd-C, Ctrl-D
  - common shortcuts for paths
  - `command [arg] [arg] [arg]` etc
  - quotes

## What we learnt?

- What the terminal is
- How to navigate, rename, move, copy, create and edit files and directories
- The structure of a command
- The fundamentals of how to use a command line interface
