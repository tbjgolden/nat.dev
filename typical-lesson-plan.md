# Other lesson 1s go like this

1. Talk for 20 minutes about how fun coding is
2. Talk about some shit like Google to make people believe they can create the next Google, hopefully distracting them from how shit and low budget your course is
3. Spend an hour trying to get everyones laptops to the same point
4. Convince everyone to open the terminal
5. Tell Russell that he opened Word, not the terminal, and to try again
6. Get everyone to copy paste commands from a web page you set up to get some basic code working.
7. Russell, Ctrl-C doesn't work in command prompt. Right click copy paste on Windows. Russell seems overwhelmed.
8. People run the code and see `Hello !`
9. Ask people to try and edit the code.

...

929202. Finally Russell edits the code to say `Hello Russell!`. Everyone else has gone home long ago. Sigh deeply.
