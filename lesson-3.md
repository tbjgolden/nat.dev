These lessons are actually not about teaching you what you can do, but about what you will do!

The value doesn't come from telling you how to fish - because even though someone might know
how to fish they might not do it. For instance they may not have a rod, or bait; they may be
scared to actually go fishing; or they could just not want to.

When taking this tired and far-fetched analogy and translating it to coding:

- the rod is the laptop
- the bait is the WiFi
- the fear is of the learning curve
- and not wanting to is ultimately based in not correctly identifying opportunity

Given that you have the laptop, and the WiFi, these lessons will mainly target the hardest bit;
the mind.

## The fear of the learning curve

This happens with every single person who learns to code.

They know it's powerful and they spend so much time considering whether it's a fit for them, or
whether it's something to be left for other "more technical" people.

So here are the numbers to help you answer that question:

| Thing | Time to learn said thing |
|:--|--:|
| To use the basic functions of the terminal so you can impress your friends (but mostly to get to the valuable stuff below) | 6 hours |
| To manipulate files/directories | 12 hours |
| To know how to effectively identify opportunities for and to implement basic algorithms (finding, searching, sorting) | 30 hours |
| To be comfortable building a basic website | 360 hours |
| To be comfortable building an app idea | 720 hours |
| To get a Computer Science bachelors degree for pretty useless skills | 3 to 4 years |
