# First language

We will learn Python as our first programming language.

Python has been chosen because:

- it's nearly ubiquitous (a version is preinstalled on macOS, Linux and is even easy to install on Windows)
- it's a popular and new dev friendly language, with plenty of questions and answers on the internet
- it generally uses english words instead of symbols, which may help for memorizing it quicker
- it's probably the simplest for basic file manipulation
- because it's easy for new devs to get something working quickly it can help get people to the "critical point"
  (basic coding becomes useful and exploratory as you get ideas of things you could use it for -> learning -> repeat with new knowledge)

However it does have some downsides:

- Sometimes Python is version 2 and sometimes it's version 3, and they are not generally interoperable
- Some pretty useful functions have hard to remember, long or unusual names (e.g. `enumerate`)
- All the typical problems that can occur with tabs and spaces for indentation
- It's actually pretty old these days
- I have bad experiences with `pip` - the dependency manager for python (often to get your code working with other people's code)
